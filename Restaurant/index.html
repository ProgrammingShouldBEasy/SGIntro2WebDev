                Steakhouse Description<br/>
                Come on down to eat street, where the food is fresh and the prices can't be beat! Don't let the name fool you, we have a wide variety of options, from salad and briskets, to hot dog and chips. Steve started cooking steak about fifty years ago and hasn't stopped since--neither has his appetite for the perfect cuts of beef. Seriously, he wont turn the stoves off. If you don't come by Steve's Steakhouse and buy some food, then all this food will go to waste. I mean, it's your choice, really, but you wouldn't want all this food to be cooked for nothing. Please buy our food so I can become a software developer.
